\arguments{
\item{formula.med}{A object of class \link{formula} relating the mediatior(s)
to the covariates (potential confounding variables).}

\item{data}{A dataset of class \link{data.frame} that includes the treatment indicator, mediator(s), and covariates.}

\item{a_treatment}{The (character) name of the treatment variable, which must be
dichotomous (0, 1).}

\item{y_outcome}{The (character) name of the outcome variable, y. If this is not provided, then
no effects will be calculated and a warning will be raised. Default : \code{NULL}.}

\item{total_effect_ps}{A ps object that contains the total effect weights,}

\item{total_effect_stop_rule}{The stopping rule (\code{ks.mean}, \code{ks.max}, \code{es.mean}, \code{es.max}) for the total effect weights, which
only needs to be specified if total_effect_ps is provided. Default : \code{NULL}.}

\item{method}{The method for getting weights ("ps", "logistic", or "crossval"). Default : \code{"ps"}.}

\item{sampw}{Optional sampling weights Default : \code{NULL}.}

\item{ps_n.trees}{Number of gbm iterations passed on to \link{gbm}. Default: 10000.}

\item{ps_interaction.depth}{A positive integer denoting the tree depth used in
gradient boosting. Default: 3.}

\item{ps_shrinkage}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 denoting the learning rate.
See \link{gbm} for more details. Default: 0.01.}

\item{ps_bag.fraction}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 denoting the fraction of
the observations randomly selected in each iteration of the gradient
boosting algorithm to propose the next tree. See \link{gbm} for
more details. Default: 1.0.}

\item{ps_n.minobsinnode}{An integer specifying the minimum number of observations
in the terminal nodes of the trees used in the gradient boosting.  See \link{gbm} for
more details. Default: 10.}

\item{ps_perm.test.iters}{A non-negative integer giving the number of iterations
of the permutation test for the KS statistic. If \code{perm.test.iters=0}
then the function returns an analytic approximation to the p-value. Setting
\code{perm.test.iters=200} will yield precision to within 3\% if the true
p-value is 0.05. Use \code{perm.test.iters=500} to be within 2\%. Default: 0.}

\item{ps_verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, lots of information will be printed to monitor the
the progress of the fitting. Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ps_stop.method}{A method or methods of measuring and summarizing balance across pretreatment
variables. Current options are \code{ks.mean}, \code{ks.max}, \code{es.mean}, and \code{es.max}. \code{ks} refers to the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and es refers to standardized effect size. These are summarized
across the pretreatment variables by either the maximum (\code{.max}) or the mean (\code{.mean}).
Default: \code{c("ks.mean", "ks.max")}.}

\item{ps_version}{"gbm", "xgboost", or "legacy", indicating which version of the twang package to use.
\itemize{
\item \code{"gbm"} uses gradient boosting from the \link{gbm} package.
\item \code{"xgboost"} uses gradient boosting from the \link{xgboost} package.
\item \code{"legacy"} uses the prior implementation of the \code{ps} function.
}}

\item{ps_ks.exact}{\code{NULL} or a logical indicating whether the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value should be based on an approximation of exact
distribution from an unweighted two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If
\code{NULL}, the approximation based on the exact distribution is computed
if the product of the effective sample sizes is less than 10,000.
Otherwise, an approximation based on the asymptotic distribution is used.
\strong{Warning:} setting \code{ks.exact = TRUE} will add substantial
computation time for larger sample sizes. Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{ps_n.keep}{A numeric variable indicating the algorithm should only
consider every \code{n.keep}-th iteration of the propensity score model and
optimize balance over this set instead of all iterations. Default : 1.}

\item{ps_n.grid}{A numeric variable that sets the grid size for an initial
search of the region most likely to minimize the \code{stop.method}. A
value of \code{n.grid=50} uses a 50 point grid from \code{1:n.trees}. It
finds the minimum, say at grid point 35. It then looks for the actual
minimum between grid points 34 and 36.If specified with \code{n.keep>1}, \code{n.grid}
corresponds to a grid of points on the kept iterations as defined by \code{n.keep}. Default: 25.}

\item{ps_cv.folds}{A numeric variable that sets the number of cross-validation folds if
using method='crossval'. Default: 10.}

\item{ps_keep.data}{A logical variable that determines if the dataset should be saved
in the resulting \code{ps} model objects. Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{total_effect_weights}{A vector of total effect weights, which if left \code{NULL}
then total_effect_ps must be supplied. Default : \code{NULL}.}
}
